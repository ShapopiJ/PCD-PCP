# Precipitation Concentration Degree (PCD) & Precipitaiton Concentration Period Calculator

## Overview
_________________

This is a python implementation for the calculation of the PCD and PCP for monthly rainfall data. I did not find anyone who shared an implementation so here you go.

I found exactly 3 papers that reference these indicators, however the indicators are quite intuitive and I am surprised they are not used more. They help you find out if and where most rainfall is in an area is concentrated throughout the year. This implementation is based on the paper by [Xuemei Li et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230282840_Spatial_and_temporal_variability_of_precipitation_concentration_index_concentration_degree_and_concentration_period_Xinjiang_China).
